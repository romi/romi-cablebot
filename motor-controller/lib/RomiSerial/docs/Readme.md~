The Romi Rover communicates with several microcontrollers over a
serial bus. The proposition below should help improve the reliability
of the serial communication. It aims to address the following issues:

* When the serial connection is used without proper synchronisation,
  the Arduino may loose data without a warning because its internal
  serial buffer overflows. This issue is addressed by limiting the
  maximum size of a message to 64 bytes and by using a synchronous
  request-response pattern.

* Without a well-defined timing between the request and the response,
  the host may wait indefinitely for a response in case the controller
  fails for some reason. The interaction therefore defines a maximum
  timeout for both the request and response handling.

* It provides a better error handling:
  * The error code is now explicitly part of the response.
  * Each request-response pair has an ID to assure that a reponse
    corresponds to the request that was sent.    
  * A CRC code is appended to the messages to assure that the messages
    are not corrupted or incomplete.

* It will distnguish more clearly between:
  * The serial link to read and write bytes
  * The protocol layer to send requests and read responses
  * The application layer that defines the semantics of the commands

This proposition decribes the protocol layer that should be shared by
all devices for which we control the firmware. A clearly defined
protocol should simplify the documentation and debugging. However,
this document does not specify the opcodes and expected arguments of
the different firmwares. These opcodes are part of the application
layer. Some normalisation of the opcodes could be the subject of a
later specification.

Unless specified otherwise, the serial connections should be set to:
115200 baudrate, 8 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit (115200 8N1).


# Message formats

The exchange always follows a request-response pattern. The formats of
the request and the response are detailed below. However, for
debugging purposes, the controller may also send log messages
asynchronously. These should be handle by the host, and the log text
treated in whatever way that is most appropriate, for example, writing
them to a log file.


## Log messages

At any time, the controller may send log messages in the following
form:

    '!' TEXT '\r'

The TEXT is a string of variable length.


## Requests:

A request is a string that consists, in summary, of a one-character
opcode followed by zero or more arguments, an ID and a cyclic
redundancy check (CRC). The precise format is as follows:

    '#' <opcode> ':' <id> <crc> '\r'
  
    '#' <opcode> '[' <arg1>, <arg2>, ... ']' ':' <id> <crc> '\r'

* the opcode consists of a single character from the following set:
  {a-z, A-Z, 0-9, ?}
* arg1, arg2 are integer numbers in the range [-32768,32767] (signed 16 bits), or
  a string with a maximum length of 32 characters (see more below). 
* id is an integer number in the range [0,255]. It is encoded as a
  two-character hexadecimal.
* crc is the 8-bit CRC code of the request, encoded as a two-character
  hexadecimal
* the carriage return character `\r` signals the end of the
  message. If a linefeed is sent after the carriage return ('\n') it
  will be ignored. This allows the firmware to handle both '\r' and
  '\r\n' as the end of message.

The hashtag indicates the start of a message. For this reason, it
should be avoided in strings passed as argument. Similarly, the
carriage return and line feed characters (CRLF) indicate the end of a
message. They should be avoided in strings.

The maximum number of integer arguments that can be given is 12.

A string argument should be surrounded by double-quotes ('"'). There
can only be one string per request.

The CRC code is computed on the string representation of the request,
starting with the hashtag until the ID (included). See below for an
implementation of thr CRC-8 algorithm.

The trailing colon, ID and CRC code are optional. This simplifies
sending commands manually from a terminal. However, request sent from
software code should always add an ID and CRC. The 8-bit CRC code is
formatted as a hexadecimal string of two characters. It must use the
lowercase letters a-f. Example a CRC with a value of 0 is formatted as
"00"; a CRC of 255 results in the string "ff".

The total length of the request, including the hashtag, ID, the CRC,
and CRLF, must not be longer than 64 bytes. This is the size of the
internal buffer used by the Arduino Uno.

## Responses:

The reponse is formatted as follows:

    '#' <opcode> '[' 0, <value1>, <value2> ... ']' ':' <id> <crc> '\r\n'

    '#' <opcode> '[' errorcode, <message> ']' ':' <id> <crc> '\r\n'

* the opcode consists of a single character. It mirrors the opcode of
  the request.
* value1, value2 are number or strings formatted compatible with the JSON
  standard.
* the errorcode is an integer (more below). 
* message is a user-readable string in double-quotes (optional). 
* id is an hexadecimal number in the range [0,255]. It mirrors the id
  of the request.
* crc is the CRC code of the textual representation of the response up
  to and including the ID.

* the firmware will finish the message with a carriage return and a
  linefeed. Both are sent because it works more nicely with terminal
  applications.

The reponse of the controller will also start with a hashtag. The
controller will then repeat the opcode of the request. The first
argument is always an error code. An error code of zero means that the
request was successful. If the error is not 0 than the second value
may be an additional short, user-readable message.

The ID mirrors the id of the original request. If none was given, it
will be zero (in case of manual commands from a terminal). The
controller will always return an ID and CRC code. The CRC code is
computed on the complete response, starting with the hashtag until
and including the ID.

## Examples

Let's look at a couple of simple examples. The first example is a
request with the opcode 'e' but without any arguments, ID, or CRC. The
string ot the request is as follows:

    #e\r
    
If all goes well (error code is 0) and controller does not return any
extra values, then the response by the controller is:

    #e[0]:0092\r\n

The controller has returned an ID of zero because none was given in
the request. The CRC-8 value of the string "#e[0]:00" is 0x92, so "92"
is appended to the response.

In the next example, the host sends a request with an ID of 123 (0x7b
in hexaecimal). The host must add a CRC code, too. The full request
string looks like the string below. The CRC-8 of '#e:7b' is 0x04:

    #e:7b04\r


The response of the controller will now also include the ID:

    #e[0]:7b40\r\n

(crc8 of #e[0]:7b is 0x40)


Here's an example in which the host sends a request with an additional
arguments (the ID is still 123):

    #M[16,"Shutdown"]:7bba\r

(crc8 of '#M[16,"Shutdown"]:7b' is 0xba)

We will assume that the request can't be completed and that the
controller returns an error message. The first value that is returned
is the error code (1 in this case) and the second an optinal error
message:

    #M[1,"Out of boundary"]:7ba7\r\n

(the CRC-8 of '#M[1,"Out of boundary"]:7b' is 0xa7.)


# Host: Time outs and message IDs

All communication is synchronous. When the host sends a request, the
controller must send a response within less than one second. The host
should therefore set a time-out when reading the response. This avoids
the risk that the host may get stuck indefinitely while waiting for a
response.

Note: The controller must reply in less than one second. However, the
host should use a time-out value that is a slightly longer than one
second.

The host may receive log messages while waiting for the reponse. In
that case, the host must treat the log message and then reattempt to
read the response. This next attempt should again use a timeout of one
second or more.

The request IDs must be incremented by one after each cycle. When the
ID reaches 255, the next ID start again at 0.

In case the controller *does* miss the one second deadline (nothing is
perfect): in that case controller may send the response *after* the
host timed out. This delayed response will then be read by the host in
a subsequent request-response cycle. The host must therefore be
prepared to handle this. It should always check the ID of the
response. If the ID of the request is different than the ID of the
request, the host should ignore the response and try reading the next
response message with a timeout of 1 second.

A call to the host's request/reponse function should never take more
than 2 seconds to complete. The host should therefore keep track of
the total time spent even when at re-attempts to read a response after
receiving a log message or a stale message.

# Controller

The controller must respond to requests within one second. Vice versa,
the host should assure that a request is completelt sent within less
than a second. If the host sends the request too slowly or if data is
lost on the connection and the complete message takes more than one
second to parse, the controller must do the following: ignore the
partially read request, return a time-out error (see below), and wait
for the beginning of a new request (initiated by the hashtag).

The error codes that are returned by the controller fall in two
categories. Errors raised by the protocol layer and errors returned by
the application. The protocol layer will only use negative error
codes. They are discussed below. The application can freely use
positive error codes.

# Error codes

TOO_LONG (-1): The controller received a message that is too long (>64
characters, including the CRLF)

TIME_OUT (-2): The host did not send the request fast enough.

BAD_CRC (-3): The controller received a invalid request: the CRC did not match.

BAD_FORMAT (-4): The controller failed to parse the request.

BAD_REQUEST (-5): Invalid opcode.




# Notes on the CRC-8

There exists several varieties of the CRC8 algorithm (see this
[https://reveng.sourceforge.io/crc-catalogue/1-15.htm#crc.cat.crc-8](catalogue)). Romi
Serial uses the CRC-8/SMBUS, or "plain" CRC-8 implementation. In the
following online CRC calculator,
[https://crccalc.com/](https://crccalc.com/), it's the first one in
the table (CRC-8).

Please check the code in the CRC8.h file.
